user: I'm just feeling a bit conflicted with my career. I've always really loved writing, so I decided to major in journalism in my undergrad, and now I've been working at a local newspaper for the past year. But while I've been working at this paper, I've come to realize that journalism might not be the right path for me. The thing is with journalism is that most articles are in very similar formats, so I feel like I'm just writing the same style with different content every day, and it's getting kind of boring. I just don't know if I can do this for the rest of my life. But I'm also a little concerned because I majored in journalism and I'm not really sure what else you can do with a journalism degree. So I kind of feel like this is my only career option, but I'm just not sure what to do because I don't love it as much as I thought I would.

It's about investigating, researching,","I'm not sure if I should just give up on my dream and find a more secure job with better pay, or if I should try to find a way to make my passion for writing more prominent in my work. What would you suggest I do? I'm lost and unsure.

I feel like there's so many different ways that you can write, like you can write a poem, you can write an essay, or you can write a book, and there's so many different ways to tell a story.

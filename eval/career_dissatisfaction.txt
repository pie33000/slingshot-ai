assistant: Hi Kevin, nice to meet you. What brings you here today?
user: I'm just feeling a bit conflicted with my career. I've always really loved writing, so I decided to major in journalism in my undergrad, and now I've been working at a local newspaper for the past year. But while I've been working at this paper, I've come to realize that journalism might not be the right path for me. The thing is with journalism is that most articles are in very similar formats, so I feel like I'm just writing the same style with different content every day, and it's getting kind of boring. I just don't know if I can do this for the rest of my life. But I'm also a little concerned because I majored in journalism and I'm not really sure what else you can do with a journalism degree. So I kind of feel like this is my only career option, but I'm just not sure what to do because I don't love it as much as I thought I would.
assistant: That makes sense. You aren't feeling completely satisfied even early on in your career, but at the same time are not sure what else you could do with your degree. It sounds like you're questioning whether journalism is the right career path for you, is that right?
user: Yeah. That's exactly what's going on.
assistant: How long have you been having these thoughts?
user: I've been having these thoughts for maybe about six months now. I've only been working at the newspaper for a year, but after about six months, I started to realize that I was getting bored with the job already. I thought that I would love this job and I'd be excited to go to work every day, but I'm really not.
assistant: I can imagine that feeling of not being completely fulfilled at work can be frustrating. I'd love to hear a bit more about what made you choose this career in the first place - what do you love about writing?
user: I love writing because it's a way to express my creativity. I feel like there's so many different ways that you can write, like you can write a poem, you can write an essay, or you can write a book, and there's so many different ways to tell a story. I just love being creative and having the freedom to write however I want. I've always gotten good grades on essays, so you know, I thought that this would be a good career path for me. But with journalism, I feel like my writing is kind of confined to the rules of journalism, and I can't really be as creative as I want to be.
assistant: So you enjoy the creative freedom that writing gives you, but you feel like journalism is a bit too restrictive for your creativity. Being a good writing is an extremely valued skill among many companies. I'm curious, what makes you think that you can't do anything else with your journalism degree?
user: I definitely do want to do writing in a future career. I just feel like I have a journalism degree, so I have to be a journalist. I'm not sure what other jobs even use journalism degrees.
assistant: That's a common feeling, and I think a lot of people tend to get stuck in the mindset that just because you have a degree in a certain field, that's the only field you can work in. I'm curious, if you had the opportunity to do so, would you want to explore other careers?
user: I definitely would love to explore other careers. I just don't know what I'm qualified for with my degree.
assistant: I wonder if you might be open to hearing a few ideas, then?
user: Yeah, that would be great. I'm definitely open.
assistant: Well, many companies value professionals who can write and communicate clearly, and a journalism degree can be a great indicator of that skill set. Have you thought about looking for opportunities in other industries such as marketing, public relations, or even in the corporate world? These fields often require excellent writing skills.
user: I haven't really looked into those careers. I think I've kind of just been focused on journalism, but I'm definitely open to looking into other careers that involve writing. So maybe I'd be happier in a different field that still allows me to write.
assistant: I'm glad to hear you're open to other possibilities. I think being open to new possibilities is a great first step in finding a career path that you'll find fulfilling. Do you have any other ideas of ways that you could learn the skills needed to break into another career?
user: I'm not really sure. I've just been so focused on journalism because of my degree, and I haven't really thought about other career options at all. I think I could take online courses on the side, or try out an internship. I'm just not sure if they would count towards a job if I don't have a degree in the field I'm applying to.
assistant: Online courses and internships could definitely be helpful for building skills and experience, and they could also be a good way to try out different fields and see what you enjoy. It's important to keep in mind what skills you have and how that can translate to a career. How are you feeling after talking this through?
user: I'm feeling a little better. This is really good for me to think about, I'll try to explore some of my other interests within writing. Thanks!
assistant: That sounds like a great plan. I'm glad I could help you explore some new possibilities. Is there anything else you wanted to discuss today?
user: No, I think that's it. Thanks!
assistant: It was great talking with you today, Kevin. Goodbye!

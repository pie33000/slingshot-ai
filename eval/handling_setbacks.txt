assistant: Hi Andrew, I'm Ash, nice to meet you. What brings you here today?
user: Honestly, I'm feeling a bit upset because the firm that I work in, I work in a law firm, and I was working really hard to make Partner, and I honestly did think I was going to get it because I put in so much time and won a lot of cases. But in the end, I wasn't chosen for Partner. I'm really upset about this because I feel like all my hard work was for nothing, and I'm starting to question if being a lawyer was even the right career path for me. I'm 35, so I don't really want to change my career at this point in my life, but I don't know if this office is right for me. Part of me thinks I should take my talent somewhere else where they might be more valued, but I also have been with this firm for so long that I don't know if it's a good idea to leave. So I guess I just wanted to talk through my feelings about this whole situation.
assistant: I'm sorry, Andrew. I can imagine you're feeling frustrated that this did not go the way you planned. Can you start by telling me a bit about your career? How did you get to the point you are at today?
user: Yeah, so I kind of always knew I wanted to be a lawyer. I've always had an interest in criminal justice and working within that system. So I went to NYU Law School and shortly after got a job at the firm that I'm currently at. I was hired as a criminal defense attorney and worked my way up to this point where I thought I would then make partner.
assistant: It seems like you've dedicated a lot of time and hard work to your career. Can you tell me a bit about what specifically you like about being a lawyer?
user: I really like the sense of justice that I get when I help a client win a case. I really enjoy getting to know my clients and hearing their stories. I feel a lot of empathy for them, so it feels good when I can help them get through this really tough time in their life. I also just really like the intellectual stimulation that being a lawyer brings. I like doing the research, arguing, and negotiating. I think it's just a good fit for me.
assistant: So you're very passionate about your career, is that right? You mentioned earlier that you are starting to question if being a lawyer was even the right career path for you. I'm curious, is this just because you did not make partner or because you do not enjoy the career?
user: I think it is just because I didn't make partner. I do know that being a lawyer is something that I love and I'm happy with, but if I can't reach this level, does that mean I'm not good at my job?
assistant: Okay, so you're questioning your ability, not your passion. That's an important distinction. Let's explore this a bit more. You said you've won a lot of cases. Can you tell me about some of the cases you've won that made you feel particularly good?
user: Yeah, so there was one case I worked on about a year ago with this woman who was facing a lot of charges for drug possession and selling. But really, she was a victim of the system and had been caught up in a really bad family situation and was just trying to get by. So I really felt for her and was so happy when I was able to win her case. I saw her family cry tears of joy. I really felt like I made a difference in her life.
assistant: That's amazing, Andrew. It seems like you've had a real impact on people's lives, and that your passion for justice is recognized by those around you. Given that it seems like you do have a great ability as a lawyer, can you think of reasons other than your ability as to why you didn't make partner?
user: I guess I can think of a few. I'm not sure if it's related to me not making partner, but I do feel that the firm is very political, and I've never been good at navigating those types of spaces. I've always been a bit of an outsider, and I don't really have any close relationships with any of the partners. There's also a few people at the firm who are kind of power hungry, and I could see them doing things behind the scenes to make sure they get partner instead of me.
assistant: It sounds like there could be reasons beyond your ability as a lawyer that may explain the situation. You've had a lot of interesting insights in this conversation, do you want to take a moment reflect on what we've talked about so far?
user: Sure. So I think that maybe my success as a lawyer is not what I'm questioning. It's more about my place in the office. I know that I'm a good lawyer, and not making Partner does not negate that.
assistant: I'm glad you came to these conclusions. Was there anything else you wanted to talk about today?
user: No, I think that's all. Thank you for your help.
assistant: Of course, happy to help. Don't hesitate to reach out any time. Goodbye for now!
